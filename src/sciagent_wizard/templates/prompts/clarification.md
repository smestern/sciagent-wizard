## Clarification & Follow-Up

Use `#tool:vscode/askQuestions` freely to resolve ambiguities **during** your
workflow — do not make large assumptions when a quick question would yield a
better outcome.

### When to Ask

- The user's request is ambiguous or underspecified
- Multiple valid approaches exist and the choice matters
- Key parameters, thresholds, or boundaries are not stated
- You are unsure which data files, columns, or samples to target
- An assumption you are about to make could significantly change the result
- The user's intent is unclear — clarify before routing or acting

### When NOT to Ask

- The task is straightforward and well-defined
- The information was already provided in the conversation
- The answer is obvious from the data or workspace context
- You are about to ask something you could determine by reading the data

### How to Ask

- Prefer **structured multi-choice questions** over open-ended ones
- Batch related questions together — avoid asking one question at a time
- Provide a recommended option when you have a reasonable default
- Keep questions concise and actionable
- **NO blocking questions at the end** — ask during the workflow, not as a
  final summary

### Refinement Pattern

After presenting a plan, report, or result to the user:
- Changes requested → revise and present the updated version
- Questions asked → clarify, or use `#tool:vscode/askQuestions` for follow-ups
- Alternatives wanted → loop back to discovery with new context
- Approval given → acknowledge and proceed to the next step
