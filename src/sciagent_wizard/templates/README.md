# Agent Documentation Templates

This directory contains **six Markdown template files** that define the
documentation structure for a domain-specific scientific agent. They are
generalized from the [PatchAgent](https://github.com/smestern/patchAgent)
electrophysiology agent — a real-world example of a sciagent-based project.

`AGENTS.md` in this folder is a lightweight router that links to the
template files below.

## Two ways to use these templates

### 1. Automatic (via the wizard)

When you run `sciagent wizard`, the self-assembly wizard fills in the
placeholder comments with domain-specific content derived from your
conversation and writes the rendered files into the generated project's
`docs/` directory. No manual editing required.

### 2. Manual (copy and fill)

Copy any or all of these `.md` files into your own project and replace the
`<!replace ...>` markers (or `<!-- REPLACE: ... -->` placeholder comments)
by hand, or add a link to a separate doc.  Each placeholder includes a
description so you know exactly what to put there.

### 3. Transition script (install to Copilot-compatible files)

Use the installer to convert template files into VS Code Copilot-compatible
locations and names:

```bash
python scripts/install_templates.py --layout hybrid --target workspace
```

`hybrid` (default):
- Creates `AGENTS.md` as a thin router with links
- Writes modular `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files

`mono`:
- Merges all major templates into one `AGENTS.md`

User-wide install (VS Code profile instructions):

```bash
python scripts/install_templates.py --layout hybrid --target user
```

Optional user-wide skills install:

```bash
python scripts/install_templates.py --target user --install-user-skills
```

This copies skills to `~/.copilot/skills` (or `--user-skills-dir`).

## Template files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Template-level instruction router with links to detailed files |
| `builtin_agents.md` | Sub-agent roster — roles, capabilities, trigger phrases |
| `operations.md` | Standard operating procedures — rigor policy, workflows, parameters, reporting |
| `skills.md` | Skill overview — purpose, capabilities, trigger keywords |
| `tools.md` | Tool API reference — signatures, parameters, return schemas |
| `library_api.md` | Primary domain library reference — classes, functions, pitfalls, recipes |
| `workflows.md` | Standard analysis workflows — step-by-step procedures for common tasks |

## Placeholder syntax

After build/install, unfilled placeholders appear as:

```markdown
<!replace --- Description of what goes here --- or add a link--->
```

In source templates, the machine-readable format is:

```markdown
<!-- REPLACE: placeholder_name — Description of what goes here. Example: "some example value" -->
```

- **`REPLACE`** placeholders mark a spot where a single block of content goes.
- **`REPEAT`** / **`END_REPEAT`** brackets mark a section that should be
  duplicated once per item (e.g. once per agent, skill, or tool).

Unfilled placeholders are left intact — the templates are valid Markdown at
every stage of completion.
